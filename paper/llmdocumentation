Move into a group that you want to on Quercus (please let me know if all the groups are full).

Use the Spotify API to download some data about a group of interest to you.

Use R or Python to make some finding. Write a short (2ish pages + appendices + references)  paper using Quarto. 

Submit a link to a GitHub repo (one repo per group) that meets the general expectations of the course.

Group Project: Spotify Data Analysis

Overview

This repository contains our group project for the course [Course Name] on Quercus. The project involves using the Spotify API to gather data on a group of interest to us, performing analysis using Python (or R), and documenting our findings in a paper created using Quarto. The focus of the analysis is to uncover insights about the group's musical trends, audience engagement, or other relevant factors.

Project Structure

Data Collection: We use the Spotify API to extract relevant data on our group of interest.
Analysis: The data is processed and analyzed using Python (or R) to generate meaningful findings.
Documentation: Our findings are documented in a short paper written using Quarto.
Appendices: The appendices section includes any additional data visualizations, code snippets, or extra findings that support our analysis.
References: Citing any relevant resources used throughout the project, including documentation on Spotify API usage.
File Descriptions

data/: This folder contains the raw and cleaned data extracted from the Spotify API.
analysis/: Contains Python (or R) scripts used for processing and analyzing the data.
report/: The Quarto file (.qmd) and the final rendered output (PDF/HTML) of our findings.
appendices/: Additional plots, graphs, or extra analyses that supplement the main paper.
Getting Started

Prerequisites
To replicate the analysis, you will need the following:

Python (or R): Make sure you have Python 3.x or R installed.
Spotify Developer Account: Create an account and register your app to get access to the Spotify API. You'll need the Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate your requests.
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
复制代码
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo.git
Install the required dependencies. You can use the provided requirements.txt for Python:
bash
复制代码
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or, if using R, follow the installation instructions in the R script.
Set up your Spotify API credentials by creating a .env file in the root directory:
bash
复制代码
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
Running the Analysis
Run the script to fetch the Spotify data:
bash
复制代码
python fetch_spotify_data.py
or, for R users:

r
复制代码
Rscript fetch_spotify_data.R
Perform the analysis:
bash
复制代码
python analysis.py
or:

r
复制代码
Rscript analysis.R
Render the Quarto document:
bash
quarto render report.qmd
Results
The analysis results, including any insights or trends we identified, will be documented in the report/report.pdf file.

scatter plot of duration and dancebility correaktion, data separated by all difference alubums.

To create a scatter plot of duration and danceability, with the data points separated by different albums, here is a general process:
Steps in R:
Load the necessary libraries (e.g., ggplot2 for visualization).
Prepare your data to ensure it has columns for duration, danceability, and album.
Plot the scatter plot using ggplot2, coloring the points based on the album column.
Here's an example R code you can use:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your data frame is named 'music_data' with columns 'duration', 'danceability', and 'album'
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = duration, y = danceability, color = album)) +
  geom_point() +  # Create scatter plot
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Duration vs Danceability by Album",
       x = "Duration",
       y = "Danceability") +
  theme_minimal()  # Apply a clean theme
This code will generate a scatter plot where each point represents a song, with the x-axis as the duration, y-axis as the danceability, and different colors representing different albums.

get a line for each albums

To add a line for each album in the scatter plot, you can use geom_smooth() in ggplot2, which will fit a smooth line for each album category. Here's how to modify the code:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your data frame is named 'music_data' with columns 'duration', 'danceability', and 'album'
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = duration, y = danceability, color = album)) +
  geom_point() +  # Create scatter plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear regression line for each album, without confidence interval
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Duration vs Danceability by Album",
       x = "Duration",
       y = "Danceability") +
  theme_minimal()  # Apply a clean theme
Key points:
geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) adds a linear regression line for each album without the shads
